"""Deterministic token/cost measurement for Agent Skills and prompt packages.

Part of the token-efficient-skill-optimizer. Extends the tier model of
token_audit.py (Anthropic anthropic-skills plugin, token-efficient-skill-builder)
with: a real-tokenizer ladder, per-file tier classification, duplicate-content
detection, and mandatory honesty labels on every number.

HONESTY CONTRACT (enforced by validate_report.py downstream):
  * bytes / lines / words            -> label "measured"  (exact, deterministic)
  * tokens via Anthropic count-tokens API -> "measured"   (exact for the named model)
  * tokens via tiktoken o200k_base   -> "estimated"       (tiktoken UNDERCOUNTS Claude
        tokens by ~15-20% on typical text per Anthropic guidance; we report the raw
        count AND a Claude-adjusted range raw*1.15 .. raw*1.25)
  * tokens via chars/words heuristic -> "estimated (wide bounds)"

Determinism: file walk is sorted, JSON uses sort_keys, no timestamps are emitted
unless --stamp is passed. Two runs on the same input are byte-identical.

Usage:
    python measure_tokens.py <skill_dir_or_file> [--json OUT.json]
        [--method auto|api|tiktoken|heuristic] [--model claude-opus-4-8] [--stamp]

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 usage error, 2 target not found.
