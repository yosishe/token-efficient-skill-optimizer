"""Deterministic test subset for token-efficient-skill-optimizer.

Covers everything checkable without a model: schema/counts of the four-split
behavioral test suite, rule-registry integrity, validator behavior on
known-good/bad fixtures, the five-label savings taxonomy, the self-contained
citation gate, cost-model effective-date windows, the eval harness run on a
fixture adapter, harness determinism, dogfood limits, config sanity.

Behavioral cases (the four .jsonl splits) themselves need a model+grader - run
them via live_eval_adapter.py when a budget is approved; they are NOT executed
here. The eval-harness tests below drive eval_runner.py/eval_report.py through
tests/fixtures/echo_adapter.py, which performs no model call at all: they test
the harness, never the skill's behavior.

EVERY test here has been mutation-verified: the behavior it claims to protect
was deliberately broken and the test was confirmed to fail. A test that has
never failed is a decoration, and this suite exists because v1.0.1 shipped
harness fixes with zero coverage and still reported all-green.

Usage: run_tests.py            (from anywhere; paths resolved relative to skill root)
Exit: 0 all green, 1 failures.
