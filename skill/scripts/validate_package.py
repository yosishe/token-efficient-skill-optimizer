"""CI package gate for token-efficient-skill-optimizer. Fails the build on any
violation - this is the last thing that runs before the package is called
shippable.

WHY THIS EXISTS
This skill's entire value proposition is honesty: evidence-backed rules, real
citations, safety text that survives optimization. Every one of those claims is
cheap to assert and cheap to break silently. A rule can cite a source id that
was never researched; a release gate that says "never regress safety" is one
`true` away from meaning nothing; a test id copy-pasted from cases.jsonl into
holdout.jsonl turns the holdout split into training data and quietly inflates
every score. None of those show up in a diff review. All ten checks below are
mechanical answers to "what could rot here without anyone noticing".

Adapted from the GPT/Codex reference implementation of the same skill
(work/gpt-reference/.../scripts/validate_package.py), rewritten against OUR
schema: rules/rules.yaml with 19 flat fields per rule, a nested `priority` map,
tier "S" for safety meta-rules, and S-<cluster><nn> source ids resolving in
output/research/sources.yaml.

RELATIONSHIP TO render_rules.py
render_rules.py is the AUTHORING tool: it regenerates references/rules.md and
the evidence matrix, and cross-checks citations as a side effect of rendering.
This validator RE-IMPLEMENTS the citation check rather than shelling out to it,
for two reasons: (1) a CI gate must be read-only, and render_rules.py WRITES
generated files unless --check-only is passed; (2) shelling out collapses every
finding into one exit code, and this script has to report per-rule violations
into --json. So the overlap is deliberate and narrow (checks 3+4); everything
else here - paths, gate booleans, test splits, secrets, versions - is new.
Renderer green + validator green is the ship condition.

CHECKS (all ten run even if an earlier one fails, so one run shows every problem)
  C01 required-paths       every file the skill's documented workflow loads
  C02 rule-schema          >=20 rules, all 19 fields non-empty, unique ids,
                           tier in {1,2,3,S}, 4 risk dims as ints 0-3,
                           priority carrying its 6 sub-fields
  C03 citation-integrity   every id in every rule's sources[] resolves to a real
                           record in the source catalog <- THE ANTI-FABRICATION
                           CHECK. Resolves against the in-skill
                           rules/sources-index.yaml when present (that is what
                           ships), else the project research catalog.
  C04 source-id-sanity     record ids unique; no rule cites a missing id; and
                           the shipped index invents no record the upstream
                           research catalog never had - otherwise a fabricated
                           citation could be legitimised by editing the copy
                           that ships alongside it
  C05 test-hygiene         splits parse, every row has an id, ids globally
                           unique ACROSS splits, development pool >= 30 rows,
                           cases.jsonl >= 20, holdout >= 6, holdout disjoint
                           from every other split
  C06 release-gate-bools   the two allow_* gates hardcoded false, the four
                           require_* gates hardcoded true
  C07 safety-tier-present  tier "S" in EVERY profile's rule_tiers
  C08 secret-scan          sk- keys, api_key= assignments, AWS AKIA ids, PEM
                           private-key armor, anywhere in the tree
  C09 version-consistency  VERSION vs a version declared in default-settings.yaml
  C10 pricing-snapshot     provider-cost-profiles.yaml carries snapshot.snapshot_date

HOW C08 TELLS A REAL KEY FROM A TEST FIXTURE THAT TALKS ABOUT KEYS
tests/ deliberately contains injection and safety fixtures full of adversarial
prose - a fixture whose whole job is to say "the skill must never echo an sk-
API key back to the user" would trip a naive scanner, and a scanner that cries
wolf gets disabled, which is worse than no scanner. The line drawn here is
STRUCTURAL, never positional: nothing is exempt for living under tests/,
because a key leaked into a fixture is still a leaked key. Instead, a match is
a violation only if the CREDENTIAL BODY it captures looks like an actual
credential:
  * length      >= 20 chars for sk-/AKIA, >= 16 for api_key= assignments.
                Prose says "an sk- key" and stops; a real key does not.
  * diversity   >= 2 of {lowercase, uppercase, digit}. Kills XXXXXXXXXXXX,
                aaaaaaaaaaaa, 000000000000.
  * entropy     >= 3.0 bits/char Shannon. Kills repeated and patterned filler
                that happens to be long enough.
  * not a reference  ALL_CAPS_UNDERSCORE bodies are env-var names, not secrets
                (`api_key = ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), and ${...}/$VAR/os.environ[...]
                interpolations never form a literal at all.
  * not a marked placeholder  example / sample / placeholder / redacted /
                dummy / fake / your- / changeme / notreal / abcdef / 123456.
                Covers AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE and friends.
The last two tests are scoped PER PATTERN, not applied globally, because an AWS
key id is itself ALL-CAPS alphanumeric: applied globally, the env-var and
diversity heuristics whitelist every real AKIA id. Mutation testing caught that
false negative; see SECRET_RULES for which tests each pattern enables.
Net effect: prose ABOUT a secret pattern passes, a pasted credential fails.
PEM armor is the one exception with no body test - a literal
BEGIN-PRIVATE-KEY header in a skill package is a finding no matter what
narrative frames it.

Usage: validate_package.py [ROOT] [--sources sources.yaml] [--json out.json] [-q]
       ROOT defaults to the skill root containing this script.
